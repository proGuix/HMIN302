# HMIN302

## Introduction

HMIN302 is an training of our master 2 (2016-2017) at the University of Montpellier. The goal is to build a web site which allow to search words in relationship with another word in the manner of a dictionary, from a dump to the web site : http://www.jeuxdemots.org/jdm-accueil.php.
